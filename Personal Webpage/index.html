    <p id=aboutme>I'm a Dominican born, Washington Heights native with a deep love for the cyber world. Ever since I played my brother's Playstation as a kid, I was fascinated with all things technology. I spent many more hours than I'd like to admit on video games and developed a deep understanding to what makes them tick and I realized, maybe I can do this myself. So I'm diving in headfirst to my dream career.</p>
    <p>One of my favorite games is league of legends.</p>

    <h3 class = "heading">I find the technologies behind games incredibly interesting. Games have come incredibly far since their ancient ancestor, Pong and the programming behind it is ingenious. Some of the most impressive things I've seen are</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Procedural map generation, such as in Minecraft or Noita</li>
        <li>Evolving branching storylines, similar to a choose-your-own adventure book but feeding a program data about certain characters and allowing that to evolve dynamically, such as the Nemesis System of the Middle Earth game series or the play as anyone features in Watch Dogs: Legion.</li>
        <li>Of course I want to familiarize myself with the different aspects of what even makes a game fun. There are so many different variables to consider and I'd love to tinker with them.</li>
    </ul>
